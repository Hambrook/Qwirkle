#Qwirkle

###A tribute from a fan

This is the code for an online version of Qwirkle that I am building as a way to improve my JS skills and learn websockets.

There will be many things that could be done better (such as using NodeJS for the server) but I'm focussing on what I want to learn.

> Note: This won't run on it's own, it's built to plug into my project sandbox system.

_I claim no ownership of Qwirkle. I just wasn't creative enough to come up with a better name and change stuff._
