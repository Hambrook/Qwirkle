<p>Qwirkle is a very fun tile-based tabletop game and I've attempted to recreate
it here for online play so that we can play remotely with our friends.</p>

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Because we miss our friends and love catching up over a casual game.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><em>Mental note: put some features here</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>What I learnt</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lots of frontend OOP Javascript stuff</li>
    <li>There are <strong>vh</strong> and <strong>vw</strong> CSS units
</ul>

<h3>Todo</h3>
<ul>
    <li>[X] Generate and randomise tileset on game creation</li>
    <li>[ ] In-game chat</li>
    <li>[ ] Pre-game UI
        <ul>
            <li>[ ] "Ready" flag for players</li>
            <li>[ ] "Start" function for host</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>[ ] Game-start sequence
        <ul>
            <li>[ ] Assign initial tiles</li>
            <li>[ ] Calculate starting player</li>
            <li>[ ] Take starting player's turn for them</li>
            <li>[ ] Trigger next player's turn</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Later</h3>
<ul>
    <li>[ ] Allow host to boot player <em>before</em> game start</li>
    <li>[ ] Allow host to boot player <em>after</em> game start</li>
</ul>
